    <h1>Michael Jordan legacy</h1>

      Jordan's talent was clear from his first NBA season; by November 1984, he
      was being compared to Julius Erving. Larry Bird said that rookie Jordan
      was the best player he ever saw, and that he was "one of a kind", and
      comparable to Wayne Gretzky as an athlete. In his first game in Madison
      Square Garden against the New York Knicks, Jordan received a near
      minute-long standing ovation. After establishing the single game playoff
      record of 63 points against the Boston Celtics on April 20, 1986, Bird
      described him as "God disguised as Michael Jordan."

      Jordan led the NBA in scoring in 10 seasons (NBA record) and tied Wilt
      Chamberlain's record of seven consecutive scoring titles. He was also a
      fixture of the NBA All-Defensive First Team, making the roster nine times
      (NBA record shared with Gary Payton, Kevin Garnett, and Kobe Bryant).
      Jordan also holds the top career regular season and playoff scoring
      averages of 30.1 and 33.4 points per game, respectively. By 1998, the
      season of his Finals-winning shot against the Jazz, he was well known
      throughout the league as a clutch performer. In the regular season, Jordan
      was the Bulls' primary threat in the final seconds of a close game and in
      the playoffs; he would always ask for the ball at crunch time. Jordan's
      total of 5,987 points in the playoffs is the second-highest in NBA
      history. He retired with 32,292 points in regular season play, placing him
      fifth on the NBA's all-time scoring list behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl
      Malone, LeBron James, and Kobe Bryant.

      With five regular season MVPs (tied for second place with Bill
      Russell—only Abdul-Jabbar has won more, with six), six Finals MVPs (NBA
      record), and three All-Star Game MVPs, Jordan is the most decorated player
      in NBA history. Jordan finished among the top three in regular season MVP
      voting 10 times, and was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA
      History in 1996. He is one of only seven players in history to win an NCAA
      championship, an NBA championship, and an Olympic gold medal (doing so
      twice with the 1984 and 1992 U.S. men's basketball teams). Since 1976, the
      year of the NBA's merger with the American Basketball Association, Jordan
      and Pippen are the only two players to win six NBA Finals playing for one
      team. In the All-Star Game fan ballot, Jordan received the most votes nine
      times, more than any other player.

      Many of Jordan's contemporaries have said that Jordan is the greatest
      basketball player of all time. In 1999, an ESPN survey of journalists,
      athletes and other sports figures ranked Jordan the greatest North
      American athlete of the 20th century, above Babe Ruth and Muhammad Ali.
      Jordan placed second to Babe Ruth in the Associated Press' December 1999
      list of 20th century athletes. In addition, the Associated Press voted him
      the greatest basketball player of the 20th century. Jordan has also
      appeared on the front cover of Sports Illustrated a record 50 times. In
      the September 1996 issue of Sport, which was the publication's
      50th-anniversary issue, Jordan was named the greatest athlete of the past
      50 years.

      Jordan's athletic leaping ability, highlighted in his back-to-back Slam
      Dunk Contest championships in 1987 and 1988, is credited by many people
      with having influenced a generation of young players. Several NBA players,
      including LeBron James and Dwyane Wade, have stated that they considered
      Jordan their role model while they were growing up. In addition,
      commentators have dubbed a number of next-generation players "the next
      Michael Jordan" upon their entry to the NBA, including Penny Hardaway,
      Grant Hill, Allen Iverson, Bryant, Vince Carter, James, and Wade. Some
      analyists, such as The Ringer's Dan Devine, drew parallels between
      Jordan's experiment at point guard in the 1988–89 season and modern NBA;
      for Devine, it "inadvertently foreshadowed the modern game's stylistic
      shift toward monster-usage primary playmakers", such as Russell Westbrook,
      James Harden, Luka Dončić, and LeBron James. Don Nelson stated: "I
      would've been playing him at point guard the day he showed up as a
      rookie."

      Although Jordan was a well-rounded player, his "Air Jordan" image is also
      often credited with inadvertently decreasing the jump shooting skills,
      defense, and fundamentals of young players, a fact Jordan himself has
      lamented: "I think it was the exposure of Michael Jordan; the marketing of
      Michael Jordan. Everything was marketed towards the things that people
      wanted to see, which was scoring and dunking. That Michael Jordan still
      played defense and an all-around game, but it was never really
      publicized." During his heyday, Jordan did much to increase the status of
      the game; television ratings increased only during his time in the league.
      The popularity of the NBA in the U.S. declined after his last title. As
      late as 2020, Finals ratings had not returned to the level reached during
      his last championship-winning season.

      In August 2009, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in
      Springfield, Massachusetts, opened a Michael Jordan exhibit that contained
      items from his college and NBA careers as well as from the 1992 "Dream
      Team"; the exhibit also has a batting glove to signify Jordan's short
      career in Minor League Baseball. After Jordan received word of his
      acceptance into the Hall of Fame, he selected Class of 1996 member David
      Thompson to present him. As Jordan would later explain during his
      induction speech in September 2009, when he was growing up in North
      Carolina, he was not a fan of the Tar Heels and greatly admired Thompson,
      who played at rival North Carolina State. In September, he was inducted
      into the Hall with several former Bulls teammates in attendance, including
      Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Charles Oakley, Ron Harper, Steve Kerr, and
      Toni Kukoč. Two of Jordan's former coaches, Dean Smith and Doug Collins,
      were also among those present. His emotional reaction during his
      speech—when he began to cry—was captured by Associated Press photographer
      Stephan Savoia and would later go viral on social media as the Crying
      Jordan Internet meme. In 2016, President Barack Obama honored Jordan with
      the Presidential Medal of Freedom. NBA career statistics
