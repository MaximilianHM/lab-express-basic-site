    <h1>About Michael Jordan</h1>

    <img src="/images/mj-about1.jpg" alt="Michael Jordan image" />

    <p>
      Michael Jeffrey Jordan (born February 17, 1963), also known by his
      initials MJ, is an American former professional basketball player and
      businessman. His biography on the official National Basketball Association
      (NBA) website states: "By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest
      basketball player of all time." He was integral in helping to popularize
      the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s, becoming a global
      cultural icon in the process. Jordan played 15 seasons in the NBA, winning
      six championships with the Chicago Bulls. He is the principal owner and
      chairman of the Charlotte Hornets of the NBA and of 23XI Racing in the
      NASCAR Cup Series.

      Jordan played college basketball for three seasons under coach Dean Smith
      with the North Carolina Tar Heels. As a freshman, he was a member of the
      Tar Heels' national championship team in 1982. Jordan joined the Bulls in
      1984 as the third overall draft pick, and quickly emerged as a league
      star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring while gaining a
      reputation as one of the game's best defensive players. His leaping
      ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks from the free throw line in
      Slam Dunk Contests, earned him the nicknames "Air Jordan" and "His
      Airness". Jordan won his first NBA championship with the Bulls in 1991,
      and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993, securing a
      "three-peat". Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the 1993–94
      NBA season to play Minor League Baseball but returned to the Bulls in
      March 1995 and led them to three more championships in 1996, 1997, and
      1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular season wins in the 1995–96 NBA
      season. He retired for the second time in January 1999 but returned for
      two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Washington
      Wizards.

      Jordan's individual accolades and accomplishments include six NBA Finals
      Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, ten scoring titles (both all-time
      records), five MVP Awards, ten All-NBA First Team designations, nine
      All-Defensive First Team honors (joint record), fourteen NBA All-Star Game
      selections, three All-Star Game MVP Awards, three steals titles, and the
      1988 NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award. He holds the NBA records for
      career regular season scoring average (30.12 points per game) and career
      playoff scoring average (33.45 points per game). In 1999, he was named the
      20th century's greatest North American athlete by ESPN, and was second to
      Babe Ruth on the Associated Press' list of athletes of the century. Jordan
      was twice inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame,
      once in 2009 for his individual career and again in 2010 as part of the
      1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team ("The Dream Team"). He
      became a member of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2015.

      One of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation, Jordan is
      also known for his product endorsements. He fueled the success of Nike's
      Air Jordan sneakers, which were introduced in 1984 and remain popular
      today. Jordan also starred as himself in the 1996 live-action animated
      film Space Jam, and is the central focus of the Emmy Award-winning
      documentary miniseries The Last Dance (2020). He became part-owner and
      head of basketball operations for the Charlotte Bobcats (now named the
      Hornets) in 2006, and bought a controlling interest in 2010. In 2014,
      Jordan became the first billionaire player in NBA history. With a net
      worth of $1.6 billion, he is the fifth-richest African American, behind
      Robert F. Smith, David Steward, Oprah Winfrey, and Kanye West.
